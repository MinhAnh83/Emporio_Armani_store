            <p>The Giorgio Armani brand owned and run by the founder designer Giorgio Armani has earned the much
                hallowed
                space
                in the fashion industry through its superior design, relevant themes and trends. It maintains the aura
                of a
                real
                luxury brand. Not only has Giorgio Armani become one of the most respected and known brand names in the
                fashion
                and luxury brand industry, it is also one of the most highly valued fashion companies in the world.</p>
            <p>Born in the northern Italian town of Piacenza in 1934, Armani later attended medical school at Piacenza
                University for two years before leaving for military service. While on leave from the military, Armani
                got a
                job
                as a window dresser at Milan department store La Rinoscente, where he worked up to a buyer position,
                marking
                his
                first foray into fashion. In 1965, Armani started working as a designer at fashion house Nino Cerruti,
                where
                he
                met Sergio Galeotti. In 1975, Giorgio Armani started the company with Galeotti.</p>
            <p>Being a designer himself, Armani made apparel with his sense of aesthetics, beauty and luxury, a sense
                that
                appealed to the elite of the society. It is a privately held company with the founder Giorgio Armani
                being
                the
                sole shareholder. With many sub-brands designed under the parent umbrella brand of Giorgio Armani to
                cater
                to
                the specific needs of different market segments, it has become one of the strongest fashion and luxury
                brands in
                the world. The brand is built on 3 pillars: class, quality and exclusivity. Its product lines cover all
                corners
                of fashion, including apparel, swimwear, accessories, perfume, cosmetics, watches, eye wear, bags and
                shoes
                for
                men, women and kids.</p>
            <p>Giorgio Armani is very expansive in Asia Pacific with its multiple future growth markets for luxury
                brands.
                For
                example, China is embracing premium fashion and luxury goods at an increasing pace, and Giorgio Armani
                has
                been
                one of the forerunners to exploit the market potential. Between 2015 and 2018, Chinese luxury brand
                consumers’
                local spending contributed twice as much growth in absolute value as their spending abroad. According to
                a
                2018
                study by global management consultancy Bain, 33% of the USD 1.4 trillion global luxury market is
                contributed
                by
                consumers in China. Giorgio Armani opened its Emporio Armani store next to Shanghai’s historic “The
                Bund” in
                2004 and has been opening stores across China since then.</p>
            <p>Unlike the usual practices of branding that are normally seen in the consumer goods industry, the
                branding
                philosophy in the fashion and luxury goods industry is quite unique and personality based. Most of the
                famous
                fashion houses like Christian Dior, Yves Saint-Laurent, Gucci, Versace and many others were built on the
                personality of the founders. As design is the most important ingredient of fashion and luxury apparel,
                the
                individual style of these designers becomes crucial to creating and sustaining the fashion brand
                strategy.
                It is
                these unique designs and patterns that reflect the personality of their creator that gives an identity
                to
                the
                brand and helps to differentiate it from the crowd.</p>
            <p>The Giorgio Armani fashion house, like many other fashion houses, has been built primarily on the unique
                personality and identity of Giorgio Armani himself. The brand takes on the identity of the founder
                through
                the
                designs created.</p>
            <p>Though this aspect of the fashion industry provides fashion houses with a strong sense of differentiation
                that
                can be conveyed in a tangible and visual form, it also poses a serious threat. When an entire brand and
                fashion
                house are built on the basis of the founders&#8217; personality and identity, it becomes a major
                challenge
                to
                keep the brand going after the demise of the founder, something many of the fashion houses have realized
                in
                the
                recent past.</p>
            <h3>The Giorgio Armani Fashion Brand Architecture</h3>
            <p>Whenever a brand gains popularity and acceptance from its target customers in its core business, the next
                obvious
                step for the brand is to charter a new course by venturing into different product lines, different
                segments,
                and
                ever different markets. This phenomenon seems common across industry sectors.</p>
            <p>Giorgio Armani with its iconic popularity amongst the elite of the society and the fashion literate
                segment
                of
                the market has followed similar steps by extending the brand. Today the Armani brand architecture
                encompasses
                one corporate brand and three sub-brands, each catering to different sets of target customers and at
                different
                price levels.</p>
            <p><strong>The signature Giorgio Armani line:</strong> This is the main collection of very high quality
                classic
                apparel that consists of the signature Armani suits, Oscar gowns and so on, which are of the
                ultra-premium
                price
                points and essentially targeting consumers in the 35 to 50 year old age group.</p>
            <p><strong>Emporio Armani:</strong> Targeted especially at the young professional segment in the 25 to 35
                year
                old
                age group, the Emporio Armani brand provides fashionable and contemporary designs that are relevant to
                the
                target customers.</p>
            <p><strong>EA7: </strong>The EA7 line was inspired by Ukrainian footballer Andriy Shevchenko, who at the
                time
                played
                for A.C. Milan and wore the number 7 jersey. It was created for everyone who loves exceptional style and
                wants
                to maximize their experience from sporting activity. This fashion label caters to a wide range of sport
                including running, fitness, golf and winter sports.</p>
            <p><strong>A/X Armani Exchange:</strong> This is the licensed brand of chain of retail outlets of Armani
                fashion
                house. This serves as the ultimate testimony to the power of the brand. By providing the entire range of
                its
                apparels and accessories, Armani Exchange provides customers with the complete feel of the luxurious
                fashion
                of
                Giorgio Armani. A/X Armani Exchange offers casual fashion of a good quality – which is exactly what the
                mass
                market of consumers desire.</p>
            <p>In 2019, the Armani Group completed its 3-year streamlining transformation and has discontinued the
                following
                lines:</p>
            <p><strong>Giorgio Armani Prive:</strong> This is Armani’s couture line developed in 2005 for the red
                carpet. It
                offers gala and award-show wear including gowns and suits that are ultra-luxurious, exemplifying the
                understated
                chic that epitomizes the essence of the Giorgio Armani brand. This line is almost exclusively targeted
                at
                the
                rich and famous.</p>
            <p><strong>Armani Collezioni:</strong> This is Armani’s venture into a slightly lower priced market segment.
                This
                basically caters to the segment of people who aspire to wear high quality Armani apparel but cannot
                afford
                the
                ultimate signature line, or to those who crave to add extra products to their existing portfolios. The
                Armani
                Collezioni brand, with a price point of almost 20% lower than the main line, provides an excellent line
                of
                affordable fashion.</p>
            <p><strong>Armani Jeans:</strong> This is the lowest range of Armani apparel. This Armani brand is to the
                value
                segment what the signature line is to the premium segment. Catering necessarily to the young adults in
                the
                18 to
                30 year old age group, the Armani Jeans collection provides a trendy yet fashionable and luxurious line
                of
                apparel.Armani Junior: This kids fashion brand was designed specifically for infants and children. The
                brand
                is
                best known for its sophisticated simplicity, sleek tailoring and classic colours. Taking inspiration
                from
                the
                adult line, sumptuous materials and attention to detail are combined to create a collection which is
                synonymous
                with quality.</p>
            <p><strong>Armani Junior</strong>: This kids fashion brand was designed specifically for infants and
                children.
                The
                brand is best known for its sophisticated simplicity, sleek tailoring and classic colours. Taking
                inspiration
                from the adult line, sumptuous materials and attention to detail are combined to create a collection
                which
                is
                synonymous with quality.</p>
            <p>The corporate brand and sub-brands help Giorgio Armani to operate in many segments of the fashion apparel
                market.
                But this is not all. Not only does Armani straddle many segments of the same product category, but also
                many
                different product categories.</p>
            <p>Leveraging its strong brand equity in the fashion apparel market, Giorgio Armani has ventured into other
                related
                categories like eye wear, watches and cosmetics. These are made available in each of the above-mentioned
                brand
                categories to ensure that it is available to the different segments of the market. It is usually argued
                that
                eye
                wear, perfumes, watches and cosmetics are strongly related to fashion and luxury and thus it is natural
                for
                fashion houses to extend their brands into these categories. Giorgio Armani is a very strong example for
                this
                argument. By leveraging its expert knowledge of the fashion and luxury industry, Armani has been able to
                come up
                with winning concepts in the other product lines of cosmetics, watches, jewellery, eye wear, underwear
                and
                loungewear.</p>
            <p>But Armani has not stopped at fashion as a product category. Armani has extended the brand into multiple
                other
                categories, such as:</p>
            <p><strong>Armani Casa (home collection):</strong> This brand shows how Giorgio Armani presents his ideal
                for
                living, his dream of the perfect environment: an intimate and comfortable space in which to relax,
                unwind
                and
                entertain. It offers up-market furniture, home accessories, textiles and decorative objects, as well as
                interior
                design services for a variety of spaces including yachts, planes and villas. In 2017, the Giorgio Armani
                parent
                brand completed a luxury home project, Smart Hero-Central Park Plaza Residences in Beijing, China, in
                partnership with Smart Hero Group. The project consists of homes, a 5A office building, a shopping
                street,
                underground malls and supporting facilities. The design and building of facilities was managed by Armani
                Casa.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Armani Beauty (fragrances and cosmetics):</strong> This beauty line reflects the signature Armani
                sophistication in its makeup, skincare and fragrances. It teams up with international makeup artists,
                like
                Linda
                Cantello, to communicate its expert knowledge in the art of beauty. Armani Beauty has also launched its
                latest
                haute couture fragrance line, Armani Privé, which focuses on showcasing the natural beauty of a single
                precious
                ingredient. One of the precious ingredients used in its fragrances is the Damask Rose, which requires
                precise
                extraction methods.</p>
            <p><strong>Armani-branded Dolci (confectionery):</strong> This is Armani’s confectionery line focused on the
                concept
                of sophistication in gifting. It offers pralines, chocolates, jams, honey, tea, bakery products and more
                with
                its signature ‘A’ logo. The range of products is exclusive and distinguishes itself not just by its high
                quality
                but also the rich and sophisticated image of its refined packaging.</p>
            <p><strong>Armani-branded Fiori (flowers):</strong> Armani/Fiori was created in 2000 and brings the refined
                taste
                and sophistication of the Armani style to the world of flowers and floral décor. The boutiques offer
                arrangements and decorative elements with clean lines in sophisticated colours. It also offers complete
                and
                personalized services and events &#8211; clients are attended to and carefully guided through the
                selection
                of
                their ideal floral arrangements or décor.</p>
            <p><strong>Armani Ristorante and Caffes (restaurants and cafes):</strong> This is a bold move by Armani to
                enter
                the
                food business, but it has been proven a success thus far. It has opened a total of 16 restaurants/
                caffes
                globally, with 1 in America, 7 in Asia and 8 in Europe. Its restaurants are located in prime cities, are
                impeccably designed and offer only the best cuisine that allows diners to dine in style, reflecting the
                brand
                philosophy.</p>
            <p><strong>Armani Hotels (hotels):</strong> Armani expanded into the hospitality industry by striking a deal
                with
                Dubai-based property group Emaar in 2005 to come up with a chain of Armani branded hotels and resorts.
                It
                unveiled its Armani Residences, a luxury collection of 144 private residence homes in Burj Dubai, the
                tallest
                building in the world in 2007 and its Armani Hotel Dubai in the same building in 2010. In 2011, it
                launched
                Armani Hotel Milano in the Manzoni 31 building, right at the heart of the prestigious Quadrilatero della
                Moda.
                In 2016, the Armani Hotel Dubai was named the most luxurious hotel in the world by the World Luxury
                Hotel
                Awards
                for its award-winning facilities as well as its warm, Italian-style service.</p>
            <p><strong>Armani Clubs (premier nightclubs):</strong> Armani has also opened premier nightclubs in Milano
                and
                Dubai, distinguished by their discreet character, impeccable design and refined elegance.</p>
            <p><strong>Armani Silos (museum):</strong> To add to this wide portfolio of brands, Armani opened Armani
                Silos
                in
                April 2015 in Milan to mark 40 years of his career. The museum is designed with the Armani design
                philosophy
                and
                creative dynamism in mind by preserving the building’s unusual beehive form and incorporating geometric
                and
                uniform elements. The museum showcases the designer’s 40-year career, including 400 outfits and 200
                accessories
                from Armani’s ready-to-wear collection from 1980 to the present.</p>
            <p>All of these other product lines embody, in all its facets, Giorgio Armani’s personal aesthetic
                philosophy,
                which
                is based on the signature qualities of elegance, sophistication and comfort.</p>
            <p>As is the trend in the fashion industry to operate in the entire spectrum from apparel, jewellery,
                cosmetics,
                watches, perfumes and luxury hotels, Armani has been able to leverage its brand equity to be present in
                most
                of
                these lucrative sectors. Giorgio Armani is truly a success story of classic brand management – appealing
                to
                people through its entire brand experience and philosophy, rather than only through its products.</p>
            <h3>Sustainability within the Armani philosophy</h3>
            <p>Sustainability is a value that resonates strongly with Armani. With its clean lines and understated
                elegance,
                Armani’s designs have always been built with enduring substance to last through fashion trends, as
                opposed
                to be
                thrown away after one season. Armani has stated that it is his wish for the fashion industry to slow
                down
                collections and produce less but of better quality. The Armani Group’s commitment to sustainability is

            <p><strong>Supply Chain:</strong> Besides including sustainability criteria in its supplier selection
                process,
                the
                Armani Group also monitors its journey toward its ‘Zero Discharge 2020’ goal of reducing
                environmentally-unfriendly chemicals through centralized management of chemical tests and restricting
                these
                substances from its supply chain.</p>
            <p><strong>Environment:</strong> The Armani Group has signed the Fashion Pact, a series of pledges aiming to
                make
                the industry greener by eliminating greenhouse gas emissions, restoring biodiversity and protecting
                species,
                and
                protecting oceans. It also chooses raw materials and packaging materials with the lowest environmental
                impact
                and opts for recyclable materials where possible.</p>
            <p><strong>Human resources:</strong> Armani respects diversity, protects equal opportunities, respects its
                employees’ work-life balance, and encourages employee growth through the Armani Development Programme,
                its
                corporate training plan.</p>
            <p><strong>Community:</strong> Through its investments and efforts in providing clean water access and
                promoting
                culture, Armani gives back to the community in which it operates. For example, it has partnered L’Oreal
                in
                executing the Acqua for Life project to provide clean water access and education to over 195,000 people
                in 3
                continents thus far.</p>
            <p>During the coronavirus pandemic, Armani also converted its factories in Italy into production centers to
                make
                single-use medical protective overalls for healthcare workers amid supply shortages. Additionally, it
                donated
                USD 2.2 million to Italian hospitals to help combat the virus.</p>
